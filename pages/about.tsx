            <p>Liner Notes is a webapp I'm making to help me add little notes / commentary to my playlists, 
                 in the fashion of '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liner_notes">liner notes</a>' 
                that artists will sometimes include in the sleeves of the records they release.

        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2> 

            <p>
                I love making & listening to playlists! &nbsp;( Ë˜ ÉœË˜) â™¬â™ªâ™«
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes when I make playlists for my friends, I'll wish that 
                there was a place for me to express: <em>"I added this because of that one time 
                you said ..."</em>, or <em>"I like the feeling but pls ignore the lyrics"</em>, 
                or <em>"this song reminds me of when we ..."</em>, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes even when I make playlists for myself, I wish I had just 
                a little more expressive power!
            </p>

                    <b>Anna</b>, for all our thoughtful convos about music & Spotify! 
                    You were the first to use the phrase "liner notes" 
                    to refer to comments you added to a playlist, and I 
                    totally took that and ran with it. 
                </li>

                    Your class provided all the structure I needed to get started, 
                    and for the 3 weeks that it ran, 
                    it was honestly one of the highlights of my summer.

                    I made because of you! The process of putting together 
                    A Monday M1Stape and that letter in 2021... ðŸ¤” that's what really got me 
                    thinking in the first place!
